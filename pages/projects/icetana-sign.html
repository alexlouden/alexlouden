![Completed sign](/static/images/icetana_sign/final.jpg)

[iCetana](https://icetana.com) recently moved office and asked me to build a sign for the new space, befitting a modern software startup. Last year I built a bare steel industrial style sign for [Unearthed](/projects/unearthed-sign/), so for this project I wanted to go for a different style and add more interest with individually addressable coloured LED strips.

We painted the rear wall of the office blue, and I built a gloss white powder coated steel sign, with frosted acrylic, backlit with DotStar RGB LED strips controlled by a Raspberry Pi. This allows us to programatically control each LED's colour and brightness (potentially for use as a [CI build light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_light_indicator) in the future). I've written some basic animations to get started:

This is the process of building the sign - click any image below to open the gallery.

![Components](/static/images/icetana_sign/sketch.jpg)
![The water jet cut steel sheet arrived](/static/images/icetana_sign/2-steel-sheet.jpeg)
![I then cut 50mm steel angle to slightly smaller than the front](/static/images/icetana_sign/3-steel-frame.jpeg)
![Welded the joins](/static/images/icetana_sign/4-welded.jpeg)
![Grounded the corners smooth](/static/images/icetana_sign/5-ground.jpeg)

![Steel frame closeup](/static/images/icetana_sign/7-frame.jpeg)
![I welded small tabs onto the front. These will be used to attach the front to the frame without having to have fasteners on the front](/static/images/icetana_sign/8-tabs.jpeg)
![The larger hole in the frame allows for some adjustability in the front positioning](/static/images/icetana_sign/9-tab-attachment.jpeg)
![I then moved on to the electronics - the parts arrived from Adafruit](/static/images/icetana_sign/11-parts.jpeg)
![I soldered a Pi Hat - a protoboard designed to be mounted to the Raspberry Pi](/static/images/icetana_sign/12-soldered.jpeg)
![The IC is a logic level shifter - it converts from the 3.3V Raspberry Pi logic to the 5V required by the DotStar RGB LED Strips](/static/images/icetana_sign/13-protoboard.jpeg)
![Completed Pi - the plugs are for a LED strip power switch, a GPIO button (with pulldown) to use as an input, and SPI to the RGB strip](/static/images/icetana_sign/14-pi.jpeg)
![I wrote a simple program to listen for button input and step through a series of pre-programmed modes](/static/images/icetana_sign/15-code.png)
![Powder coating complete](/static/images/icetana_sign/16-powder-coating.jpeg)
![Power button mounted](/static/images/icetana_sign/17-button.jpeg)
![I tapped the front tabs](/static/images/icetana_sign/18-tapped.jpeg)
![LED strips were glued in place with epoxy](/static/images/icetana_sign/19-led-strips.jpeg)
![Electronics completed](/static/images/icetana_sign/20-electronics.jpeg)
![The sign was then delivered and mounted to the wall](/static/images/icetana_sign/final.jpg)
