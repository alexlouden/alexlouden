Firstly, we need to [download the latest Raspbian](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest) (~430MB).
Extract the zip file and grab the image file - it should be called something like `2019-06-20-raspbian-buster-lite.img`.

Next, plug the microSD card into your computer and find out which disk number it is. For me it's usually `disk2`.

```bash
diskutil list
```

<pre style="white-space:pre"><code>/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0

/dev/disk1 (synthesized):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +250.8 GB   disk1

   4:                APFS Volume VM                      14.0 GB    disk1s4

/dev/disk2 (internal, physical):                                                  <-----
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.9 GB    disk2

The microSD card has come formatted and has automatically mounted, so we need to unmount it to allow overwriting it:

```bash
diskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk2
```

We can then copy the Raspbian disk image onto the microSD card using `dd`. This will take a few minutes.

```bash
sudo dd bs=1m if=2019-06-20-raspbian-buster-lite.img of=/dev/rdisk2 conv=sync
```

Once it's written it'll again mount a volume called `boot`. We can enable SSH on boot by writing a file called `ssh` in this volume:

```bash
touch /Volumes/boot/ssh
```

To enable network access over the USB cable from our mac to the Pi we can enable the modules `dwc2` and `g_ether`. (You'll need to manually edit these files - here I'm using `vi`)

```bash
# Add "dtoverlay=dwc2" on new line at end of file
vi /Volumes/boot/config.txt

# Add "modules-load=dwc2,g_ether" to end of line (after "rootwait")
vi /Volumes/boot/cmdline.txt
```

Finally, eject it and insert it into the Pi.

```bash
diskutil eject /dev/disk2
# Disk /dev/disk2 ejected
```

From here we can connect a USB cable to it from our mac, and SSH into it locally (using the default password `raspberry`):

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
# ...
# pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```
