So, you've just come back from holiday. A huge feature branch with hundreds of commits has been merged to develop, and your unit test is failing. You're not sure what has broken it - there are lots of model, view and library changes, and you don't want to spend the next week reading through commits to figure out what's broken.

Enter [git bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) - a tool built into git which helps you find which commit introduced a bug.

You start by running `git bisect start`, and then telling bisect that the currently checked out commit is bad with `git bisect bad`.

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad
```

Then you find a commit which you know is good, for example the latest tagged release. You can use either a commit hash, branch or tag name.

```bash
git bisect good v2.1
```

Now, you simply tell git how to run the unit test you're interested in with the following syntax:

```bash
git bisect run python manage.py test project.tests.TestClass.test_name --noinput
```

Or if you're using [`nose`](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) this looks like:

```bash
git bisect run python manage.py test project.tests.test_filename:TestClass.test_name --noinput
```

Then git bisect does it's magic, performing binary search from your current commit to the broken one, eventually pinpointing which commit introduced the bug.

    0b5c07c is the first bad commit


Then you can check out this commit, read through what changed, fix it, and take the rest of the week off!
